# circles
Graphical Image output of circles drawn within each other. Option to play with size/colour/number of iterations


# Problem Description
Take a circle and draw it. Next iteration, draw another 7 circles, inside of the original
one. The inside circles have 1/3 radius as shown in the Figure 1. Do it again, and again,
and . . . How creative can you get?

Circles either takes no input, or a file specififying the radius to use per each new iteration. This file should have one specification per line in the format 'radius r g b' where r g b are colour values up to 255 e.g. "1/3 0 255 100".
